# Loan-Default-Classification-Using-Machine-Learning-Python-
The study focuses on exploring the relationship between different factors and the probability
of loan default to minimize the risks taken by financial institutions. In this case, we are using
two classification models (Decision Tree and Light GBM), and find that interest rate spread,
upfront charges are two significant drivers of increasing the probability of default on loans.
Overall, the results sound very promising with an AUC approximately equal to 1 by using the
Light BGM model. We assume that the models fit well in this particular dataset. If the
explanations hold up on similar datasets, their use in the banking sector or other
financial-related area could be explored.
Some future efforts could be done to strengthen the model and reduce the model complexity
to achieve a better result.
